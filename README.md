# symstore

A python module and command line utility for publishing windows debugging symbols to symbols store.
The symbols published in this format can be consumed by the common development tools for windows, such as Visual Studio and WinDbg.
See [Using SymStore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/using-symstore) for more information on windows symbols store.

Currently it is possible to publish PDB and PE (exe and dll) files to a local file system.

## Installing

Symstore is available on pypi and conda package repositories.
It can be installed with ``pip`` or ``conda`` utilities, see below.

### Pip

Install symstore with pip utility by running:

    $ pip install symstore

This will install the command line utility ``symstore`` as well as python module ``symstore``.

It is also possible to install symstore package from source code.
For example, clone symstore's git repository with:

    $ git clone <repo-url> symstore

and install it with pip:

    $ pip install symstore/

### Conda

The symstore package is available on ``conda-forge`` channel.
To install it, activate your conda environment and run:

    $ conda install --channel conda-forge symstore

## Using

### command line

Use the ``symstore`` command to publish the symbols. Run ``symstore --help`` for details.

### Python module

To publish symbols programmatically use the ``symstore`` module.
See ``symstore/command_line.py`` for an example on how to use the API.

### Compression

The symstore package supports compressing the data files when publishing them.
This can lead to significant reduction of data that needs to be transferred while accessing symbols.

The compression mode is activated with ``--compress`` or ``-z`` flag to ``symstore`` command line utility.

On non-Windows systems, symstore uses the native ``gcab`` library via python bindings to compress data.
The required packages must be available on the system for the compression mode to work.

On Ubuntu 22.04, install following packages:

 * gir1.2-gcab-1.0
 * python3-gi

On Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04, install following packages:

  * gir1.2-gcab-1.0
  * python-gi

On Ubuntu 16.04, install following packages:

  * gir1.2-libgcab-1.0
  * python-gi

On FreeBSD 12.2, install following binary packages:

 * gcab
 * py37-gobject3

If symstore is unable to load required packages while compression mode is requested, following error message will be displayed:

    gcab module not available, compression not supported

#### Virtual Environments

When installing symstore inside virtual environment, care needs to be taken in order to make compression work.
The ``gcab`` library and it's bindings must be accessible from the virtual environment.

This can be accomplished by enabling access to ``system site packages`` inside the environment.
When creating the environment with ``venv`` or ``virtualenv``, use ``--system-site-packages`` flag
to enable access.

Below is an example of enabling access to system site packages when using ``venv`` module.

    $ python3 -m venv --system-site-packages  <evironment-name>

Note that the ``gcab`` packages listed above needs to be installed before creating the virtual environment.

#### Windows

On Windows systems, symstore uses the standard `makecab.exe` utility.
The `makecab.exe` utility normally is included by default in Windows installations, thus symstore compression will work out-of-box.
